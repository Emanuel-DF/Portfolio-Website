<p>Working closely with the digital team at Kensington Palace I produce a website which included a competition submission form enabling people of all ages to submit a photographic portrait, taken in a six-week period during May and June. Over 31,000 submissions were received from across the country, with entrants ranging from 4 to 75 years-old. From these, a panel of judges selected 100 portraits. I then created a website to showcase these photos for the world to explore.</p>
<p>The microsite won the best use of digital from the Museums and Heritage awards 2020.</p>

<div class="col">
<p>The last two years have seen a surge in online exhibitions as museums and galleries pivot to digital first, I have been exploring what particular digital exhibition models are more successful at engaging audiences. We have experimented with different forms of online engagement during closure, building microsites with Kensington Palace such as Hold Still, working with teams across the Gallery to build a microsite with a digital rendering of the physical BP Portrait Award, and in this talk I share what we as a team/department have learned.</p>
