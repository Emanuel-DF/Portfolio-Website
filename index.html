<p>Working closely with the digital team at Kensington Palace I produce a website which included a competition submission form enabling people of all ages to submit a photographic portrait, taken in a six-week period during May and June. Over 31,000 submissions were received from across the country, with entrants ranging from 4 to 75 years-old. From these, a panel of judges selected 100 portraits. I then created a website to showcase these photos for the world to explore.</p>
<p>The microsite won the best use of digital from the Museums and Heritage awards 2020.</p>

<h3>Creating, managing and updating award winning exhibitions for the National Portrait Gallery</h3>

<div class="col">
<p>The last two years have seen a surge in online exhibitions as museums and galleries pivot to digital first, I have been exploring what particular digital exhibition models are more successful at engaging audiences. We have experimented with different forms of online engagement during closure, building microsites with Kensington Palace such as Hold Still, working with teams across the Gallery to build a microsite with a digital rendering of the physical BP Portrait Award, and in this talk I share what we as a team/department have learned.</p>

    <h3>Creating, designing and project managing a brand new template</h3>
    </div>
    <img alt="Screenshot of a banner on London Metropolitan University website course page" src="images/london-met-course.png" width="100%">
    <div class="col">
<p>My first task as a digital manager at London Met University was to create a brand new course page template with an external agency, the web team in ITS and the Marketing team. The sole focus of this project was to increase conversion and generate leads. My main focus was to make the page SEO friendly while hyperfocusing on accessibility. We also took feedback from our current students using research we had gathered from the website to build this template. Later on I would work to make sure we deployed a course schema for each course they these could be easily found in search engines. Each course template has a writen meta description and we reused all ready created content such as course videos, student testimonials and students work to to give a rich experience. We ran campaigns which would present users with a unique phone number which would allow us to track our retargeting ads attribution traffic to ensure cost of investment.</p>
